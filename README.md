# stctm
*stctm* (STellar ConTamination Modeling) performs spectral retrievals on exoplanet transmission spectra assuming that the spectrum can be explained by stellar contamination alone.


If you use this code, please cite Caroline Piaulet-Ghorayeb.
First public release: Piaulet-Ghorayeb et al., submitted.

Previous uses of the code (and for now, papers to cite as its best description):
* Lim et al., 2023 (https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2023ApJ...955L..22L/abstract), on TRAPPIST-1 b
* Roy et al., 2023 (https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2023ApJ...954L..52R/abstract), on GJ 9827 d
* Benneke et al., submitted, on TRAPPIST-1 g

Bare-bones skeleton of the code released for now - full user instructions and user-friendly setup to come soon!

I provide as an example for the application of *stctm* to Visit 1 of TRAPPIST-1 b (Lim et al., 2023, https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2023ApJ...955L..22L/abstract), fitting for two populations of heterogeneities: spots, faculae, and allowing the log g of the heterogeneities to vary relative to that of the star.
