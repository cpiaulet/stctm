Contributing to STCTM
=====================

If you find a bug in the code that you should be looked into or would like to request or build new features into the code, here's how to proceed.

* bugs can be reported on `GitHub <https://github.com/cpiaulet/stctm/issues>`_.
* you should similarly request new features on `GitHub <https://github.com/cpiaulet/stctm/issues>`_.
* for feature building, please follow best practices and either fork the repository or create a new branch out of the :code:`main` branch which contains the official code release, so your feature can be tested before the pull request is merged.

Feel free to create pull requests even for small feature additions or bug fixes: the open-source nature of this code is of course meant to encourage usage beyond the usage I initially created it for. Looking forward to your contributions!
